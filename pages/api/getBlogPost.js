  title: "How to Find Great Speakers That Drive More Attendance",
  htmlContent: `
  <p>One of the most important factors in maximizing registration and attendance for a professional event is the speaker lineup.</p>
  <p>But who are the best speakers to invite?</p>
  <p>You might think that the best option is to find speakers who are known for their engaging and well-delivered presentations.</p>
  <p>A speaker’s ability to deliver an engaging talk can be a major factor in attendee satisfaction and retention (i.e. coming back for subsequent events).</p>

  <p>But, most registrants don’t actually spend too much time researching a speaker’s presentation skills before registering.</p>
  <p>In this article we’re going to teach you exactly how registrants decide on whether they’ll attend an event.</p>
  <p>Being armed with this knowledge, you’ll be able to drive more registrations to your events.</p>
  <h2>Why People Register for Events?</h2>
  <p>A registrant’s decision to register for an event often has little to do with the speaker’s ability to give a good talk.</p>
  <p>The perception that the speaker will hear a great story and will learn something insightful that is applicable to their job is a much stronger motivation for registering.</p>
  <p>Let me explain with an example.</p>
  <p>Imagine you run across two events on the same day, at the same time, on the same topic:</p>
  <ol>
      <li>A talk by a Product Manager at a small tax-software startup</li>
      <li>A talk by the VP of Product Management of Intuit</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Which one would you register for?</p>
  <p>Even if speaker #1 is a better speaker, more people will likely register for #2.</p>
  <p>Why?</p>
  <p>Intuit is a big-name brand and VP of Product Management is a senior role and sounds quite important.</p>
  <p>Also, Intuit is a well-known success story. The product has been used by millions of people.</p>
  <p>Professionals want insights into how a company like that operates.</p>
  <p>The Intuit story sounds like it would be more of an engaging story, in the same way that a blockbuster movie will likely sell more tickets than an indie films.</p>
  <p>People don’t register for an event because of the speaker, they register because they want to hear a great story and be inspired.</p>
  <p>Having a well-known speaker will certainly help drive more registrations, but it’s still easy to drive an audience with lesser-known speakers if you know how to tap into a registrant’s actual motivations.</p>
  <h2>The formula for speakers that drive attendance</h2>
  <p>A speaker who is well-known for giving great talks is always an obvious choice, when available. But many events don’t have the budget to pay a well-known, professional speakers.</p>
  <p>Instead, if you’re trying to drive an audience of professionals, you can bring in speakers or panelists who are experienced in the same job function, role, or industry as the audience you want to attract.</p>
  <p>But, you’ll want to find someone who is fairly senior and work for a prominent company.</p>
  <p>These factors are both important because the combination creates intrigue.</p>
  <p>A junior person at a big company is not so intriguing, because there wouldn’t be a perception of learning from their years of knowledge.</p>
  <p>A senior person at a boring or less-successful company is also not very intriguing, because there wouldn’t be a perception of learning from a fascinating success story.</p>
  <p>You want to find senior speakers from prominent companies.</p>
  <p>Interestingly, it’s not just the size of the company that plays a factor in the perception of success or prominence.</p>
  <p>For example, we’ve found that more people will register for an event with a speaker from a company like Uber than from one like IBM.</p>
  <p>IBM has 10 times the employee count and has been around much longer, but in the public eye, they are not as intriguing of a story today.</p>
  <p>A quick search comparison on Google Trends makes that evident.</p>

  </figure>
  <p>That’s not to say that an IBM speaker can’t deliver an amazing presentation, but as an event organizer you have to be aware of audience perception of your speaker lineup.</p>
  <p>Smart and experienced event organizers will use these decision-making insights to their advantage.</p>
  <p>For example, if a speaker used to have a fancy title at a prominent company, but then moves to a lesser known company, an organizer might market the event by referencing their old title.</p>
  <p>You’ve probably seen events with titles like: “Former Intuit VP of Product: How to Scale a Product Organization”</p>
  <p>Skipcard’s formula for rating prospective speakers involves three factors:</p>
  <ol>
      <li><strong><em>Company</em></strong> - Does the speaker work at prominent company with a fascinating story?</li>
      <li><strong><em>Seniority</em></strong> - Is the speaker fairly senior at their company, or do they have deep insights into a fascinating project / product?</li>
      <li><strong><em>Speaker Reputation</em></strong> - Is the speaker known for being a fascinating speaker?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Note the emphasis on <strong><em>fascinating </em></strong>in all of these factors.</p>
  <p>So, for example, when we posted the event registration page for a talk with Gibson Biddle, former VP of Product at Netflix, we hit the trifecta.</p>
  <p>Netflix is a well-known and “fascinating” company. VP of Product sounds (and is) very important. And Gibson is also a prolific speaker who gives very engaging talks.</p>

  </figure>
  <p>Though the third factor is nice to have, it’s not required. Though it definitely helps, your speakers don’t have to be well known for delivering great presentations. You can drive a great audience by finding speakers that match the first two factors.</p>
  <h2>Tips for a great speaker lineup</h2>
  <p>There are a lot of different event formats that you can go with, but unless you have a speaker that matches all three factors we listed above, we highly recommend having multiple speakers or panelists.</p>
  <p>Having two or three speakers or panelists will allow you to attract attendees with different interests in speakers or topics.</p>
  <p>But, not all the speakers necessarily need to meet all the factors that we’ve laid out. If an attendee is interested enough to attend an event for one speaker, then having one “headline” speaker might be enough.</p>
  <p>Also, keep in mind that our formula is just one way to find speakers, but you can always break away from this formula to find other types of speakers. For example, we’ve had great speakers who come from academia, or who are best-selling authors.</p>
  <p>For example, we had Nir Eyal, author of the books Hooked and Indistractable speak at an event in 2019. Though he hasn’t had any senior roles at any prominent companies, he is a best-selling author with a well-established personal brand.</p>
